  ## Credits
    Special shout out to a few of my classmates for pitching in last minute and walking me through the process of creating a working application. After a wild 6 months of classes, work, and a pandemic, everyone involved in this class is greatly appreciated and I hope to take what I've learned from my teachers and peers and continue to hone my skills in this field.
